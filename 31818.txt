Today should have been 31st August 2018 (Actually it is 1st September[] 2018 00:51)
Yay your birthday month. 

cntd:
At that time, after our exams, I remember we sat together. I don't know what we talked but I remembered one thing.
We discussed that we were going to change our schools. Now, I think it was in 4th (exam time).
It felt bad when we said that, but not so bad...
Maybe I wasn't into you so much at that time.
Maybe, I did not want to think about that.
Maybe I thought (still think) that you are an individual and have a right to choose what you like.
Whatever it was, I had a little attracion towards you. I liked your hairstyle.
You were so pretty, so cute. You had dimples I agree, but something that was even more appealing, waaa..ss...your cheerfulness.
You had a very fickle[] nature. You were very volatile. 
You could easily mix up with anyone.
I wanted to befriend you, but I was afraid of being teased (Yeah I know, that's so childish) .
But really, what I thought was, it was wrong, It was not the right time, not hte right age, not the right.. what not.
I remember it was the time when your family was going to shift to new house in Homkar Nagar. You used to take some chocolates from a shop near the main gate. I don't clearly remember. It's been a long time. I even had a dream in which We had shifted in your colony.
I get a lot of dreams. I'll tell some of them to you later.
I am still working on the wesite part. I need to add some factors so that .. Ok wait . Maybe you have seen it (If I have completed, that is).

ps:
Hope you are online on 22 september
Should I post this beforehand? -maybe not.
