Today is 29th August [2018]

 It's a lot of time for your cumpleanos.[it's read as cumplianyos].
 But not enough for creating this site.
 This feels preety lame.
 Am I really going to gift you a website?.
 Lets see what happens.
 For one, you won't look up to me otherwise ..Ugrhh... this is so embarrassing.
 Did I just do that? - I just checked the spelling of embarrassing[] on my phone.
 You see, I haven't[] written english words for a long time.
 I have written scientific words though.
 I will represent such words with '[]' further onwards.
 I still remember you.
 I have been watching you since 4th/5th.
 Do you have a boyfriend?.
 OMG!! I just briefed for a moment.
 I shouldn't have said that....I shouldn't..no.. .
 Lets just see. I am afraid that if I wrote everything here, I wouldn't be able to write anything later.
 Should I write the next part now itself?.
 Well, I have Exams tomorrow.
 Don't worry these have became a routine[] sort of thing.
 That word was correct!. Anyways, please read these 'Diary notes' one per day.
 It will be more fun. But the choice is yours. (I bet you are good at managing....).
 You can contact me here:"vthonte@gmail.com".
 Oh yes, you are not too frequent on Facebook (or maybe you ignore me), But you can see me there too.
 There are a lot of things I want to share but please wait for tomorrow.
 Can we be friends again? I would like to listen from you too.
 I want to know you more.
 {I have already waited for long please don't dont disappoint me}.
 And if you have exams or important academics, by all means, ignore all this and concentrate on studies.
 If you remember me (the one from fourth/fifth) well and good.
 If you don't, wow! thats a surprising story.
 But I don't have any way to confirm this till you contact me.
 Even if you don't like me, theres nothing wrong in reading this.
 Wait for tomorrow, or read the next now, hm, I still haven't written anything. 

{????} you.


PS[]: 

cumpleanos is in spanish.
[] indicates referenced from net. (just for you to know).


will I really post this? lets see.
