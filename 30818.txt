Today should have been 30 August (But it's not. Its 31st of August)

As expected, I missed my note writing yesterday. Goddd.. this is typical me!. 
Well, I had exams too, but that's not an acceptable excuse.
Would I write two notes today? lets see.....   maybe...
Now, it's still some time for your birthday. I am assuming you are well. (I don't have any way to know)
If at all any one of us needs to be unwell, it should be me.
I'll pray god that you and your dear ones always be happy and healthy.
I don't have a lot to say....
I just keep on remembering you. I miss you. Just remembered a song from a touching animated movie:

....REMEMBER ME... THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE, REMEMBER ME....

It's from Coco(2017) , you must surely watch this movie.
Dad had called me today. It's been a long time since he talked me on phone.
Normally we don't talk on phone. Maybe mummy told him to call me. 
My family is kinda different. We (normally males) don't talk a lot amongst each other. Silly right?
Yeah, it's somewhat weird. I think I have got cold. Hey, did you have cold?
Coz this is very sudden. Like, just now. Even if it is, it's .... good. Oh my god, I have got cough too!.
You see, we were in same auto in 4th/5th. (I am not sure about the exact time)
I was in Siddheshwar too. (If you don't remember me)
Theres one more thing that I want to tell you, but I think now's not the right time.
Maybe I'll just split this into half. I am feeling sleepy. Good night/Good Morning/Good afternoon/Good Evening & Good bye. See you later.
